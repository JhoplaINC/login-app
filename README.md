### LoginApp

This project is focused mainly in show how would I develop a login authenticator.

### How does it works?

As we know, login apps need a backend and a database to compare the login info with our internal info.
In this case, I'll use only session storage feature.
So, we will see a list with those users we can login in with and, if you try to log in with an unregisterted account, we we'll be able to see the common Error message

### How is it built?

This project was built using Angular V18 - Angular CLI
